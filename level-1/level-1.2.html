    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Is Too Much With Us</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH </p><br><br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—
        Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
        This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
        The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
        For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
        It moves us not. Great God! I'd rather be
        A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
        Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
        Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
        Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.
