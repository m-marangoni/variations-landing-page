        <p>The World Is Too Much With Us
            <p>BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
                <p>The world is too much with us; late and soon,
                    <p>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—
                        <p>Little we see in Nature that is ours;
                            <p>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
                                <p>This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
                                    <p>The winds that will be howling at all hours,</p>
                                    And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;</p>
                                For this, for everything, we are out of tune;</p>
                            It moves us not. Great God! I'd rather be</p>
                        A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;</p>
                    So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</p>
                Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</p>
            Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</p>
        Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.
